By all of us working hard to follow these policies we can **keep our commnity safe**, **care for all the animals at the shelter**, and **end this incident much faster**!
<b>Thank you all for everything you do!!!!!!</b>
<br /><br />

## Biosecurity Levels
Each animal in the shelter has a biosecurity level that tells us their relation to the flu.
<br /><br />

- **Level 1**: Our naive population. Animals who have not been exposed.
- **Level 2**: Dogs we know have been exposed, but are not currently showing symptoms.
- **Level 3**: Dogs who are recovering or have recovered from the flu.
- **Level 4**: Dogs who are currently undergoing treatment for the flu.
<br /><br />

Work with animals in number order.<br />
First Level 1<br />
Next Level 2<br />
You can work with 3 and 4 together<br />
<br />

You must wear the PPE listing on their sign and switch between each animal.
<br /><br />

**Please only go to OGL or NYA in a single day. Don't go to both**

## Adoptions
Adoptions happen at BOTH New York Avenue and Oglethorpe.
<br /><br />

New York Avenue is only dogs. Patrons look through the binder in the lobby, pick a dog to meet, and then wait to be escorted to the yard to meet the dog.
<br /><br />

Oglethorpe has adoptions for all animals.
<br /><br />

Cats follow normal procedures. They register and then walk around the cat room before deciding who to meet.
<br /><br />

Small Animals and Turtles follow normal procedures. They are assigned a representitive to walk with them to meet the animals.
<br /><br />

Dogs are back to walk-throughs. The patron must wear shoe covers and can browse Main Dog Room. 
When they find someone they want to meet, they return to the lobby to get a represetitive. 
Then, everyone wears full PPE to meet the dog in the play yard.
<br /><br />

The Small Dog room is off limits to the public. They must get a representitive to escort them into the small dog room.
<br /><br />

A few reminders:
<br /><br />
- Adoptions are all SAME DAY.
- There is a binder at the greeter desk with all the other available OGL dogs.
- Fees are waived at various times. Ask adoption staff.
- Any Level 2, 3, or 4 level dog MUST be quarentined for 21-28 days from OUTSIDE dogs.
- We ARE doing test drive again (yay).
- Dogs currently on flu treatement (or any other medicine) will be sent home with medicine.
- If someone wants to meet multiple species they must do it in order: Small Animals and Cats, then Dogs.
