The [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) is the animal shelter for Washington, D.C.
<br /><br />
I spend a lot of my time volunteering there, and have a great group of people who cares a lot about the animals in our care and our community.
Right now, we are dealing with high instances of [cainine influenza](https://www.humanerescuealliance.org/blog/posts/what-you-need-to-know-about-canine-influenza).
<br /><br />

This page is a guide for the volunteers at HRA. It is meant to be an always-up-to-date home for current flu policies.
<br /><br />

By all of us working hard to follow these policies we can **keep our commnity safe**, **care for all the animals at the shelter**, and **end this incident much faster**!
<br /><br />

**Thank you all for everything you do!!!!!!**
<br /><br />

## Biosecurity Levels
Each animal in the shelter has a biosecurity level that tells us their relation to the flu.
<br /><br />

Work with animals in number order. Once you work with a 2, you can no longer work with 1.
After a 4, no 3,2, or 1. Etc.
<br /><br />

You must wear PPE in between each animal. The PPE you must wear is on their biosecurity sign.
<br /><br />

Anytime it is over 85 degrees, you can wear a regular PPE gown instead of Tyvek suit, if you want.
<br /><br />

- **Level 1**: Our naive population. Animals who have not been exposed.
- **Level 2**: Dogs we know have been exposed, but are not currently showing symptoms.
- **Level 3**: Dogs who are recovoring or have recovered from the flu.
- **Level 4**: Dogs who are currently undergoing treatment for the flu.

## Dog Housing Locations
### New York Avenue
- Dogs at NYA are all levels 2, 3, or 4.
- There are no puppies or other animals at NYA.
- Volunteers can work with any dog you are qualified for at NYA

### Oglethorpe
- The **Front Lobby** is a <span style="color: green">CLEAN ZONE</span>. If walking dogs, do not enter.
- The **Main Dog Room** is an <span style="color: maroon">EXPOSED ZONE</span>. Volunteers can work here.

or through the BRC park.
- Dog holding is what used to be the small animal room, and is through the door in the Small Dog Room.

## Adoptions
Adoptions happen at BOTH New York Avenue and Oglethorpe.
<br /><br />

New York Avenue is only dogs. Patrons look through the binder in the lobby, pick a dog to meet, and then wait to be escorted to the yard to meet the dog.
<br /><br />

Oglethorpe has adoptions for all animals.
<br /><br />

Cats follow normal procedures. They register and then walk around the cat room before deciding who to meet.
<br /><br />

Small Animals and Turtles follow normal procedures. They are assigned a representitive to walk with them to meet the animals.
<br /><br />

Dogs are back to walk-throughs. The patron must wear shoe covers and can browse Main Dog Room. When they find someone they want to meet,
they return to the lobby to get a represetitive. Then, everyone wheres full PPE to meet the dog in the play yard.
<br /><br />

A few reminders:
<br /><br />
- Adoptions are all SAME DAY.
- There is a binder at the greeter desk with all the other available OGL dogs.
- Fees are waived at various times. Ask adoption staff.
- Any Level 2, 3, or 4 level dog MUST be quarentined for 21-28 days after being adopted.
- We ARE doing test drive again (yay).
- Dogs currently on flu treatement (or any other medicine) will be sent home with medicine.
- If someone wants to meet multiple species they must do it in order: Small Animals, Cats, Dogs.
