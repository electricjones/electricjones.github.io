The [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) is the animal shelter for Washington, D.C.
<br /><br />

## We Have Done It!
Pat yourself and everyone around you on the back. Both locations have been cleared of the flu.
<br /><br />

Now its important to follow the new protocols so we can keep the spaces clear and get the dogs adopted!
<br /><br />

### For Both Locations
#### PPE Protocol
PPE stations should still be available in all animal housing areas when needed for the following circumstances.
<br /><br />

**Gown and gloves required when:**
- Handling any dog or cat under 6 months of age. Signs will be placed on individual dog or cat enclosure for those animals requiring full PPE.
- Handling any animal with diarrhea or URI. Signs will be placed on individual dog or cat enclosure for those animals requiring full PPE 
**Gloves are encouraged when:**
- Handling any healthy adult dog or cat.

#### Biosecurity levels:
- Rooms will no longer be designated with specific biosecurity level distinctions.
- Cross-species volunteering can now be done (moving between dog, cat, small rooms).
- There will continue to be no movement of dogs between NYA and Oglethorpe (in either direction), unless instructed. This is how we will continue to keep dogs healthy and prevent the spread of disease.

#### Volunteering:
Full movement between facilities is now allowed (Oglethorpe to NYA and NYA to Oglethorpe). **We still have a lot of dogs and need volunteers to care for them**
<br /><br />
