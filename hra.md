The [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) is the animal shelter for Washington, D.C.
I spend a lot of my time volunteering there, and have a great group of people who cares a lot about the animals in our care and our community.
Right now, we are dealing with high instances of [cainine influenza](https://www.humanerescuealliance.org/blog/posts/what-you-need-to-know-about-canine-influenza).

This page is a guide for the volunteers at HRA. It is meant to be an always-up-to-date home for current flu policies.
