The [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) is the animal shelter for Washington, D.C.
<br /><br />

## Update on Strep Zoo
There has been a single confirmed case of a new bacterial infection. The dog in question **is been stable**, and receiving excellent care and is on a treatment plan that includes anti-anxiety medication and enrichment..
<br /><br />

All other exposed dogs are also being treated, just in case.
<br /><br />

To make sure we contain any other instances, the following protocols are now in place:
<br /><br />

- NO ONE may move between NYA and OGL on the same day. NO EXCPETIONS.
- Exposed animals should only be handled by specific Animal Care and Medical Staff.
- We will be moving some dogs from NYA into the OGL Training room. These dogs are being cared for by a specific team of staff. PLEASE DO NOT ENTER THE TRAINING ROOM.
- We are continuing in-shelter adoptions.
- We are continuing our offsite adoption events only with pets currently in foster.
- We are adding a waiver to any dogs that go into a home, whether through adoption, foster, or Return-to-Owner.
- Dog walking will continue, and gloves should be worn and changed between each dog.
- Dogs in 15 OGL should only be walked down the hill.
- 71 OGL dogs should only be walked up the hill.

## Normal PPE Guidelines (business as usual) 
PPE stations should still be available in all animal housing areas when needed for the following circumstances.
<br /><br />

**Gown and gloves required when:**
- Handling any dog or cat under 6 months of age. Signs will be placed on individual dog or cat enclosure for those animals requiring full PPE.
- Handling any animal with diarrhea or URI. Signs will be placed on individual dog or cat enclosure for those animals requiring full PPE 
**Gloves are encouraged when:**
- Handling any healthy adult dog or cat.

## Frequenly Asked Questions About Strep ZOO
### Can this disease be treated?
Yes! It has been successfully treated in other shelters with antibiotics that we have available.
<br /><br />

### How is this disease spread?
It can spread from dog to dog via direct contact or through the environment.
Rescue cleaning solution can effectively kill the bacteria, but it will survive in standing water.
<br /><br />

### What symptoms do infected dogs have?
Unexpectedly passing away without any symptoms
Coughing, sneezing, nasal or ocular discharge, difficulty breathing, shortness or breath, and lethargy
<br /><br />

### Am I, as the caregiver, at risk of developing this disease?
This disease is zoonotic, meaning it can pass from animals to humans, but there have been very, very few cases of known transmission from a dog to a human in a shelter setting.
Wearing gloves and appropriate PPE during dog interactions, changing PPE between animals, and washing your hands after each animal interaction can prevent the spread of the disease to other animals and humans.
<br /><br />

### Can this disease affect other animals?
Technically, yes, this disease can be transmitted from dogs to cats, however this is also very rare and is not a huge concern at this time. 
Transmission can be prevented through proper PPE use and washing your hands after each animal interaction. 
<br /><br />

### I have dogs and cats at home, are they going to get sick after I come home from the shelter?
The risk of exposure is low, but still technically a concern.
Dogs with pre-existing conditions or other illnesses are more at risk and should not be handled unless you have changed your clothes and washed your hands.
