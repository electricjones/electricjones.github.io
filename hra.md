The [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) is the animal shelter for Washington, D.C.
I spend a lot of my time volunteering there, and have a great group of people who cares a lot about the animals in our care and our community.
Right now, we are dealing with high instances of [cainine influenza](https://www.humanerescuealliance.org/blog/posts/what-you-need-to-know-about-canine-influenza).
<br /><br />

This page is a guide for the volunteers at HRA. It is meant to be an always-up-to-date home for current flu policies.
<br /><br />

To make changes to this page, do one of the following:
- [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/electricjones/electricjones.github.io) on github.com
- Email volunteer <at> humanerescuealliance.org
- Email mwilson <at> electricjones.me
<br /><br />

By all of us working hard to follow these policies we can **keep our commnity safe**, **care for all the animals at the shelter**, and **end this incident much faster**!
<br /><br />

**Thank you all for everything you do!!!!!!**
<br /><br />

## Biosecurity Levels
Each animal in the shelter has a biosecurity level that tells us their relation to the flu.
<br /><br />

Work with animals in number order. Once you work with a 2, you can no longer work with 1.
After a 4, no 3,2, or 1. Etc.
<br /><br />

You must wear PPE in between each animal. The PPE you must wear is on their biosecurity sign.
<br /><br />

Anytime it is over 85 degrees, you can wear a regular PPE gown instead of Tyvek suit, if you want.

- **Level 1**: Our naive population. Animals who have not been exposed.
- **Level 2**: Dogs we know have been exposed, but are not currently showing symptoms.
- **Level 3**: Dogs who are recovoring or have recovered from the flu.
- **Level 4**: Dogs who are currently undergoing treatment for the flu.
