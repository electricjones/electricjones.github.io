We are making progress! Together we have cleared New York Avenue, which is now a clean  zone!
<b>Thank you all for everything you do!!!!!!</b>
<br /><br />

## Biosecurity Levels
- **Level 1**: Our naive population. Animals who have not been exposed.
- **Level 2**: Dogs we know have been exposed, but are not currently showing symptoms.
- **Level 3**: Dogs who are recovering or have recovered from the flu.
- **Level 4**: Dogs who are currently undergoing treatment for the flu.
<br />

Work with animals in number order.<br />
First Level 1<br />
Next Level 2<br />
You can work with 3 and 4 together<br />
<br />

You must wear the PPE listing on their sign and switch between each animal.
<br /><br />

## Two Locations and MOST Imoportant Notes
<b>New York Avenue</b> is a <span style="color: green">CLEAN ZONE</span>.
<br />
<b>Oglethorpe</b> is an <span style="color: maroon">EXPOSED ZONE</span>.
<br /><br />

IMPORTANT - There will need to be NO movement of people between OGL and NYA on the same day. Period. Only go to one location per day.
<br /><br />

EQUALLY IMPORTANT - Clothing must be washed after working one location before moving to the other. 
<br /><br />

INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT - PPE protocols at OGL will stay the same. At NYA, we will revert to "pre-pandemic" biosecurity, which includes wearing and changing gloves between each animal and frequent hand-washing. Gowns must be worn for animals under 6 months of age and any animals exhibiting upper respiratory symptoms. Read the manuals for guidence. 
<br /><br />

PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT - Clothing and shoes aren't the only things that spread germs. Equipment, tools, treatbags, etc. can and do spread disease. Please do not move them between locations!
<br /><br />

Staff and volunteers who use personal equipment, like treat bags, must not use them at both locations. 
<br /><br />

### New York Avenue
This is a totally <span style="color: green">CLEAN ZONE</span>.
<br /><br />

- Volunteers can work with any dog you are qualified for at NYA.
- PPE required for URI, diarrhea, and puppies.
- Gloves and hand sanatizer always and forever.
- NEVER go to OGL and NYA on the same day.
- Let's keep this place clean!

### Oglethorpe
This is a totally <span style="color: maroon">EXPOSED ZONE</span>
<br /> <br />

- All dogs at OGL are Level 2, 3, or 4.
- Volunteers can work in ANY and ALL of the areas where there are dogs.
- The front Lobby and Cat Room are clean zones. DO NOT enter once you have been in an EXPOSED zone.
- There are **temporarily** dogs on the Bridge. Take them out through managers area, NOT the front lobby.

#### Locations
- The 71 - **Main Dog Room**
- The 71 - **Small Dog Room**
- The 71 - **Holding** and **vestibule** near small dog room
- The 71 - **Overflow** (formerly warehouse)
- The 15 - **Intake Holding** (formerly Large Training Room)
- The 15 - **Small Training Room**

- The 71 - **Bridge**
<br />

<b>NOTE</b>: There is a Parvo Exposure in various places <span style="color: red">NEVER</span> walk or interact with Parvo Exposed Dogs!!
<br /><br />

## Adoptions
Adoptions happen at BOTH New York Avenue and Oglethorpe.
<br /><br />

New York Avenue is only dogs. Patrons look through the binder in the lobby, pick a dog to meet, and then wait to be escorted to the yard to meet the dog.
<br /><br />

Oglethorpe has adoptions for all animals.
<br /><br />

Cats follow normal procedures. They register and then walk around the cat room before deciding who to meet.
<br /><br />

Small Animals and Turtles follow normal procedures. They are assigned a representitive to walk with them to meet the animals.
<br /><br />

Dogs are back to walk-throughs. The patron must wear shoe covers and can browse Main Dog Room. 
When they find someone they want to meet, they return to the lobby to get a represetitive. 
Then, everyone wears full PPE to meet the dog in the play yard.
<br /><br />

The Small Dog room is off limits to the public. They must get a representitive to escort them into the small dog room.
<br /><br />

A few reminders:
<br /><br />
- Adoptions are all SAME DAY.
- There is a binder at the greeter desk with all the other available OGL dogs.
- Fees are waived at various times. Ask adoption staff.
- Any Level 2, 3, or 4 level dog MUST be quarentined for 21-28 days from OUTSIDE dogs.
- We ARE doing test drive again (yay).
- Dogs currently on flu treatement (or any other medicine) will be sent home with medicine.
- If someone wants to meet multiple species they must do it in order: Small Animals and Cats, then Dogs.
