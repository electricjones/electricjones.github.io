I am a researcher who thrives on creative collaboration with passionate people solving complex problems. 
My interests lie at the many intersections of Computer Science, Anthropology, Game Sciences, and Conservation. 
<br /><br />

I first started programming in fourth grade (thank you Meadowbrook Elementary for a one-computer lab). 
Since then I have worked in just about every area of computer science from operating systems to UI frameworks, 
but have always viewed software as a <b>tool</b> to solve some of our most challenging problems. 
As with many, making games has been a powerful expression of my computer science interest.
<br /><br />

While software has been a big part of my journey, most of my education is in social science. 
I have a Masters in Anthropology and an M.Ed. in Educational Psychology. 
My academic research focused around Educational and Impact Storytelling, Fan Communities, Narrative Identity, and Folklore. 
I love people and am addicted to stories.
<br /><br />

But who can live in front of a computer? 
The most meaningful moments of my life have involved nature, non-human animals, and conservation. 
From many years working in city shelters, to scuba diving, river cleanups, and citizen science projects. 
<br /><br />

Now, as an independent researcher, 
I get to mix all of those passions in my cauldron and toss in some creative collaboration with brilliant people. 
My current work is in Game Sciences and Citizen Conservation, culminating in helping to pioneer the academic study of Environmental Game Design. 
<br /><br />

This blog is a place to document my journey, to share my research, 
and (most importantly) to "Learn Out Loud" so we can all sharpen each other.
