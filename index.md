I'm a researcher who thrives on creative collaboration with passionate people solving complex problems. 
My interests lie at the many intersections of Computer Science, Anthropology, Game Sciences, and Conservation. 
<br /><br />

I started programming in fourth grade (thanks Meadowbrook Elementary for a one-computer lab). 
Since then I have worked in just about every area of computer science. 
As with many, making games has been a powerful expression of my computer science interest.
<br /><br />

Most of my education is actually in social science, though. 
I have a Masters in Anthropology and an M.Ed. in Educational Psychology. 
My academic research focused around Educational Storytelling, Fan Communities, Narrative Identity, and Folklore. 
I love people and am addicted to stories.
<br /><br />

But who can live in front of a computer? 
The most meaningful moments of my life have involved nature, non-human animals, and conservation. 
From many years working in city shelters, to scuba diving, river cleanups, and citizen science projects. 
<br /><br />

Now, as an independent researcher, 
I get to mix all of those passions in my cauldron and toss in some creative collaboration with brilliant people. 
<br /><br />

This blog is a place to document my journey, to share my research, 
and (most importantly) to "Learn Out Loud" so we can all sharpen each other.
