    I thrive on creative collaboration with smart, passionate people solving complex problems using computer science. 
    I also view life like an old school action rpg, and this site is the map I leave for others to join me on my journey.

I am a computer scientist, scholar, storyteller, and
conservationist. I first started programming in fourth grade
(thank you Meadowbrook Elementary for a one-computer lab). I
haven’t looked back. I am fascinated by how things work, how we
can make them work better, and how we can use them to make the
world better. <br /><br />

I thrive on creative collaboration with smart, passionate people
tackling complex, impactful problems. This means uniting teams of
people from different disciplines: engineers, artists,
storytellers, organizers, and more.
<br /><br />

I see computer science (and engineering in general) as tools for
great impact. There is enormous value in sharpening the tool, or
in advancing the tool for its own sake. I call this “Craft”.
<br /><br />

But a tool is meant to be used, and the applications for computer
science are nearly endless. I call this “Domain”.
<br /><br />

My primary “Craft Interests” involve new forms of computing, especially Quantum and Embedded Computing. The
“Domains” I am most passionate about are citizen science, ecology/conservation, and impactful gaming.
