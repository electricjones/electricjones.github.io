<b><i>"Who goes there?"</i></b>
{: .article_paragraph }

We've been working through the fever dream of a novel Animal Welfare Data Management Platform. So far we laid out an enormous list of "wouldn't it be great if"s. Then, we took a shot at a data modelling system to give us maximum flexibility and semantic richness with as little overhead as possible. I reccommend you look at the last two entries in this series to catch up.

Now, we will get into the fun stuff. Let's build up a whiteboard full of potential resources and relationships to see what the concrete version of that data model **could** look like.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
{: .article_subtitle }
This has been a messy (and hopefully not too confusing) exploration of what a data model for Animal Welfare Data could look like. This is not at all a complete example, but a simple discover of a system that could be used.

In any case, as I mentioned before, this is NOT a proposal or pitch or business plan. This is not a document about implementation. This is a space to dream.
