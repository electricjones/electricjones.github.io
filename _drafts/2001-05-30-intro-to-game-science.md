This blog ([Electric Jones](http://electricjones.me)) is divided into three major categories: [Game Studies](http://electricjones.me/games), [Etcetera](http://electricjones.me/etcetera), and **[Citizen Conservation](http://electricjones.me/ecology)**. Citizen Conservation is my musings and projects around ecology, animal welfare, and citizen science.Etcetera is just a grab bag of things I'm interested in. Game Science is an eclectic mix of my interests in game design, development, studies, and history. Let's explore that.

First, let me clarify what "game" means here. This blog casts a very wide net around the concept of "game" to include puzzles, interactive play, video games, card games, and table top games. Specific articles may define game more specifically.
