D - Language, Runtime, Libraries

@Eddie Gutierrez These are great questions. I'll speak to the general one and post it in the main channel too.
There are really 3 things going on here (well three I'll mention): Javascript, Node, and Express.
Javascript is the language. It is the "here's how to do a loop or set a variable" and the "semi colons go here and parentheses go here".
The thing about languages is that they are abstract meaning they are just ideas. Just like in English, there are rules about pronunciation and word order and contractions. That list of rules is (basically) the language. But its just a bunch of ideas until someone actually does something with it.
Node is called a runtime (similar to a compiler or an interpreter or a virtual machine. for this purpose they are all the same).
A runtime is the thing that actually does something with that language. Think of it like a paper and pen. That is how you get "your ideas" + "language rules" into a form that others can use. Other ways may be typing or speaking. You can think of each of those "mediums" as different runtimes.
The other runtime you are used to is the browser (probably chrome). The runtimes in languages execute the code. The runtimes read the code and actually carry out the actions.
Express is a framework or a library. That is just a collection of functions that someone else made for you (in this case lots of someone elses). Basically, you could do all of this w/o Express, but you'd have to write thousands of extra lines of code. In this case others have written all that code for you and you just use it.

If Javascript is just a set of rules, its good to ask "what happens when I console.log() ? Remember that the language just says what order you put things in. It doesn't actually "do" anything.
For console.log() there is actually a library built into the runtime (chrome) called console. That library is how you, the developer, can tell the runtime to interact with the console. One of those methods is the log() function. There is nothing super special about it. It's just some code that someone wrote for you so you don't have to worry about knowing how to do that complicated thing.

So, back to your example.
Javascript is the rules of the language and in this case Node is your runtime. It's just like your browser except it doesn't actually have a window and doesn't paint pictures. Instead it runs on your computer and has other powers (like opening and saving files). Node comes with built-in libraries to do those things, just like chrome comes with console.log().

This is a great explanation, if itâ€™s okay with you, I will save this into my workspace to refer back to it!

One of those "built in super powers" is to start up a webserver to publish websites and APIs. But in order to use the built in webserver you have to do a ton of extra stuff.
That's where express comes in. Someone else took care of all the "behind the scenes stuff" like routing, caching, requests, responses, etc. (You'll learn about some of those in time).

All that to say, basically everything you see here is express. Someone made a framework (a collection of libraries). One of those libraries is router which has methods like get(). That's just a normal function. You could write that if you want. In this case, the get() function takes a string as the first parameter and another function as the second parameter.
Same with app. That's just a library that has a bunch of functions in it, including use(). It's no different than any function you'll write except you get to be lazy and live off of other's hard work :wink:
