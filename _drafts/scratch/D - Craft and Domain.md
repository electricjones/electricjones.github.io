D - Craft and Domain

Very few "revolutions" have the sort of impact that is truly revolutionary at a human scale: [The Taming of Fire](wikipedia), [The Agricultural Revolution](wikipedia), [The Industrial Revolution(s)](wikipedia), [The Green Revolution](wikipedia), and the [Information Revolution](wikipedia). Well, I burn myself with fire, can't grow a crop to save my life, and live in the wrong time to really be a part of the industrial revolutions. 

But I've been hacking away on computers for about as long as I can remember. The *Information Revolution*, that's home.

This revolution we're a part of is changing every aspect of the human existence. Some for the better and some for the worse. Computing has brought us new crop varieties, helped cure disease, made our cities smarter, and untold numbers of other things.

We are still in the dark ages of the information revolution, but what a time to be alive!

We use *computing techiques* (algorightms, blockchain, AI/ML) to *do things* (trade stocks, sequence genomes, play games). That distinction is the one I want to explore in this post.

## Craft
"Craft" is the collection of all the computer-science-y things we can do. They are the every-growing lists of tools in our belt. Algorithms, Blockchain, AI/ML, Quantum Computing, Data Processing, UI/UX Design, Game Physics Simulation, and on and on and on.

These tools are fascinating and complex and interweve with each other to build a web of things that no one person could comprehend. This is where we spend our time as software engineers -- learning the new algorithm or platform or technique. We sharpen our skills in docker and stay current with robotics or AR/VR breakthroughs. We get caught up in the "how".

But anyone who has been developing professionally, seriously, for more than 5 years will tell you that's only half -- and maybe not even half -- of the job. The tools mean nothing if not *applied* in some way.

## Domain
These are usually non-computer-science-y fields to which we bring the awesome power of computation. Another seemingly endless list including Finance, Biology, Infrastructure, Real Estate, Medicine, Gaming, and advertising. 

Most of these domains existed long before we had silicon processors. They've always relied on computation, just the human sort that was slow and prone to error. The application of what we now know as computers (from smart tosters to the Cray Super Computer) has been like a bolt of lighting directly into the veigns of these fields. We can explore more, build more, do more than ever before with no end in sight.

## Why The Distinction?
This is an obvious distinction that most don't ever mention. We say "I work in Real Estate Software" (which I do) or "My company" protects and distributes medical records". At most we'll say "we use blockchain to carry out financial transactions".

And you know what, there's nothing wrong with that. Who cares?

The only reason I make the distinction here is because I have **two** focuses on this blog and in my work. One is squarely rooted in **Craft** and the other in **Domain**. So, I find it helpful to keep the two buckets distinct in my mind, though the interplay between them is like the two hemispheres of a brain.

I want to pioneer. I want to explore. I want to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible and make significant impacts along the way. I have always admired the work done in the early days of industries and fields (like the 60s and 70s of computer science). I want to live, there, on the edge with anyone crazy enough.

So, I have found two edges -- one in Craft and one in Domain.

### Quantum Computing
QC is my adventure in Craft. It's an entirely new way of computing, divorced of almost everything we have built in classical computing over the last decades. It's a brand new frontier. You can read more about that [in my Quantum Computing Section](quantum-computing).

### Computational Ecology
Comp. Eco is a different kind of frontier. We are not building new ways of computing, or entirely new modes of processing. Instead, we are finding creative ways to apply the tools we have in new ways, to solve new problems. This could be in data processing, or using robots to aid in conservation, or in education and awareness. In most cases, it isn't about making a new hammer, but about adapting an existing hammer to a new kind of nail. You can explore more of that in my [Computational Ecology](comp-eco) section.

## Just For Me
This post was more "rant-y" than most, but I wanted to put it all out there. I distinguish between craft and domain a lot in my work, and I am always keenly aware of the interplay between them when solving any problem. So, I thought it would be useful to document my thought. Maybe there is someone else out there with the kind of mind who would find it useful. Maybe I'm alone in a virtual room talking to myself. Either way, its a good day :)
