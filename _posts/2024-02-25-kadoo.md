<b><i>"A paw, a feather, a fin, and a friend."</i></b>
{: .article_paragraph }

In my continuing the experiment with a ["Planning Out Loud"](http://electricjones.me/etcetera/2024/01/03/learning-out-loud), I am open sourcing my thoughts about data management in animal welfare spaces. This post is not a proposal for a specific piece of software. It is not a business plan, a pitch, or a critique of existing systems. Instead, these are my raw dreams concerning ways we can simultaneously:
{: .article_paragraph }

1. Improve data about nonhuman animal companions, 
2. Improve the working functions of those we entrust with their care, and
3. Foster stronger connections between animal care spaces and the communities they serve. 

This is a wide-open fantasy about what *could* be, if only we had our 3 wishes.
{: .article_paragraph }

First, a little bit about my background. I have worked with animals my entire life. I had many animal companions growing up (dogs, cats, rabbits, and all the smalls). I learned patience and empathy from them. I grew fascinated by the ecological connections and conservation more generally. For the last decade, I have volunteered animal shelters, rescues, and other conservation spaces. I currently volunteer about 20 hours a week at the [Humane Rescue Alliance](http://humanerescuealliance.org) in Washington, D.C. as a beharior assistent, adoptions counselor, and volunteer trainer.
{: .article_paragraph }

In other news, I have been programming for about 30 years, and have worked professionally as a data engineer for nearly a decade. In that work, I have collaborated on national data standards, built data systems that handle terabytes, and created tools for data management and analysis. In the last 2 years, I have worked extensively in AI research.
{: .article_paragraph }

I live at the intersection of those two wolrds. About two years ago, I began thinking about data in animal welfare. Since then I have collected ideas, talked with professionals, and researched existing solutions.

## Introducing Kadoo!
![Kadoo the Cat](/assets/images/kadoo-photo.jpg)

Kadoo is an alumni of the Humane Rescue Alliance. A long length of stay cat who had some special challenges. I have never seen a group of people work harder and with more compassion than the staff and volunteers in caring for Kadoo. Personally, he meant a lot to me. When he was adopted, there were a lot of tear eyes :)
{: .article_paragraph }

The **Kadoo Platform** is a **Data First** and **Community Focused** tool that is **Practical** for the user and meant to be as **Invisible** to the actual work as possible. It's a fully integrated set of tools that keeps track of the animals data (history, notes, medical, etc) and provides views and tools to discover powerful insights from that data. It also integrates other important functions of animal welfare spaces such as volunteering, policies, and some communication.
{: .article_paragraph }

It is also innovative. It integrates artificial intelligence, not as a gimmick, but in order to make the tool fade into the work. More on that throughout.
{: .article_paragraph }

Last, its important to note that most of my experience is in animal shelters and rescues for domestic animals, but the hope is that the system would be equally useful to non-domesticatd animal welfare organizations as well.
{: .article_paragraph }

## Data First
Standardized data that is accessible (fully) through the Managment Tool (a web admin dashboard), a robust API, and Custom Dashboards. Kadoo can pull in aggragate data from other sources and synthesize dashboards and reports.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Data Realms
Just some of the kind of data Kadoo would likely need to manage.
{: .article_paragraph }

- Animal Information (species, breed, weight, location, etc)
- Memos (of various types)
- Cases (for animal control and law enforcement)
- Behavior (treatments, observations, outcomes, etc)
- Medical (vaccines, alterations, general health)
- Intake and Outcome
- Timelines automatically generated from all of the above and more.
- Marketing
- Media

### Roles and Permissions
Every item of data is assigned permissions, which correspond to various roles. Users with those permissions can view that data.
{: .article_paragraph }

Importantly it is fine-grained enough to allow someone to view an animal, but only the memos and items they have permission to see. In addition, you can redact specific text data and assign permissions so that individuals cannot see personally identifiable infomration, for example.
{: .article_paragraph }

Some possible roles include
{: .article_paragraph }

- Admins with wide array of access
- Staff with all animal related data, but limited confidential information
- Volunteers with only access to data required for their roles
- Adopters and Fosters have access to about their animal
- Community members can view available animals

### Keeping Tabs
- Newsfeeds, watch, share
- Each user has a newsfeed with their "watched" animals or pieces of data.
- Users can share animals via static links
- Custom reports can be made based off of custom searches
- Broadcast events can be made programatically on certain data chages. For example, when an animal is adopted, add the name to a spreadsheet shared by the marketing department.

### API and Standardized Data
The full and robust API has the same permissions structure. All data is standardized with metadata and fully queryable using GraphQL or some custom query syntax. Queries can be saved and even subscribed for alerts.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Block Centric Data, Great Relationships
All the data is standardized with relationships and each individual item (like a memo) is independent and can have multiple owners. For example, a memo about a playgroup can be attached to multiple dogs.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Eventing Workflow
Events are fired when certain data changes. These events can then trigger data cleanup (like finalizing an adoption outcome on a status change) or be subscribed to by external systems (like a light indicator above each cat condo that signifies the current stage) or emails sent (to alert the finder that the animal they found was adopted).
{: .article_paragraph }

### Data Collection and Input
- Kadoo is both mobile and desktop friendly. Logged in uses can manage the full data from these intuitive interfaces.
- Kadoo includes a Large Language Model Chatbot that has realtime access to the data and is bound by the same permissions. Allowing for natural language data collection (in the chat say "Save this note for Quinn . . .") including voice to text.
- Produce a general QR code for volunteers and staff to easily report behavior or medical information for any animals.
- Produce a specific QR code for volunteers and staff to easily report behavior or medical information for that specific animal.
- The same Large Language Model can auto-tag pre-defined tags based on the animals history (no-cats, good-with-children, ongoing-medical-care-needed)

### Data Hygine and Validations
- A Large Language Model can help suggest ways to make a note more objective, specific, and non-anthropomorphizing.
- Data is sanatized before being saved

## Community Focused
It's important to remember that the data is just describing real life. That families and their non-human companions are at the center of animal welfare work. Community focused means that Kadoo provides tools to empower community connections.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Family Case Management
Most animal welfare agencies do a lot more than shelter, rehabilite, and release animals. They make connections through pet pantries, vaccine clinics, education systems, and often personalized community care (like treat to return programs).
{: .article_paragraph }

Kadoo will help track these interactions. It can track general data such as locations and amount of supplies distributed at a pantry, but also specific information such as family interactions with a medical team. Families can be given a specific dashboard and access to the personalized chat agent to help them find their records and the resources they need.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Adopters Dashboard
Similar to Case Management dashboards, individuals who adopt animals are given a specific dashboard for themselves that provides information about the animals they've adopted. That information is displayed based on the roles and permissions discussed earlier, but can contain medical records, some behavior information, etc. It also allows for a chat feature both with AI and with humans where all the communication is kept in a single place for easy reference. The dashboard also allows the adopter to provide followup information and photos.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Fosters Dashboard
Fosters have access to their current foster case, can communicate cleanly with case managers, and report behavior and medical observations and concerns. They also have a nice record of the animals they've fostered with outcomes and followup information if the adopter ever provides it.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Integrated Volunteer Management
Volunteers are the life's blood of any animal welfare organization. Kadoo would provide basic volunteer management including
{: .article_paragraph }

- Creating, schduling, and signing up for opportunities
- Basic training credentials and locked opportunities
- Volunteer communication
- Training platform for basic online orientations and quizzes
- Tracking of hours and engagement reporting

### Policy Bullitens and Books
Kadoo can keep a centralized collection of policies for staff, volunteers, and community. These can be updated frequently (such as URI protocols). These bullitens can also be integrated with the AI LLM to provide answers to questions. Lastly, alerts can be sent out when policies change.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Bios, Kennel Cards, Tagging
In order to facilitate more seamless adoption interactions, Kaddo (through the AI LLM) can create public facing marketing bios, produce kennel cards, and add tags to the animals (no-kids, medical-issue, good-with-dogs, etc) based on the history and notes. This also allows for a much more easily digestable summary to be shared in a Meet and Greet instead of the staff/volunteer having to parse complex information in an animals notes.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Automatically Scour for Lost Pets
Finding owners who have lost their pets is a time consuming process. Kadoo can make that easier by accepting a list of local places where people post their missing pets. It can then use text summarization, geo data, and image similarity recognition to flag potential matches.
{: .article_paragraph }

## Practical and Invisible
The purpose of any tool should be to get out of the users way and facilitate a more efficient and joyful experience in accomplishing the task. In this case, Kadoo should "get out of the way" and allow staff, volunteers, and community members to focus more time and energy on their animal care and community building efforts.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Multiple Views
As has been discussed, the primary way that Kadoo serves multiple stake holders is by providing multiple, individualized view onto the data. Someone with a specific role sees only the data they are permitted to see. And, that data is presented in a way that makes sense for them. Some of the views discussed so far are:
{: .article_paragraph }

- Staff Views with appropriate data filtering by permission
- Volunteer Views with appropriate data filtering by permission
- Adopter View with information about their adoptions
- Foster View with their past and current cases
- Community Case View for individuals using the services of the organization
- Open Community View to be used for adoptions
- Donor View with highlighted information for donors.
- Raw Data View via the API (also bound by permissions) 

### Clean, Modern, Friendly UI
The most important ways a software can become invisible is by being intuitive and using modern design grammmar.
{: .article_paragraph }

## A Special Note on AI
Artifical Intelligence and Large Language Models have been mentioned many times throughout this document. I wanted to stress that this is not for gimmicks sake. AI is only proposed where it can reasonably (with today's level of competency) be used to enhance the workflow and the data. AI produced work is also confirmed by humans. So, the LLM will draft a bio (for example) but a human has to edit and publish it. AI may suggest objective language revisions, but the human inputing the note has to accept and publish the note.
{: .article_paragraph }

Just to tie it all together, this is a list of AI features from above and some others that didn't fit anywhere: 
{: .article_paragraph }

- Objective language suggestions
- Creating marketing bios
- Answering questions about policy
- Answering basic customer care questions for the public (when is the next pet pantry, etc)
- Answering basic questions about the animal based on reported data
- Auto tagging animals with behavior and medical tags
- Matching stray animals with lost reports
- Summarizing animal notes
- Providing technical help for the API

In all cases, the AI is bound by the same roles and permissions that the user has.
{: .article_paragraph }

For all of these, I propose a specific Large Language Model, to be trained from a Foundational Model. I will name that model <b>Quin</b> also after an alumni from the Humane Rescue Alliance, a dog who was the victim of a backyard breeder. That single model, with appropriate gates and computer vision capability, would be able to provide the services above.
{: .article_paragraph }

## Conclusion and Next Steps
This is a "Planning Out Loud" project and is meant to be messy and incomplete. It is a roughly organized dump of my interviews and thoughts over the last 2 or so years. It needs to be cleaned up and expanded upon. It also needs to be reviewed by other professionals.
{: .article_paragraph }

In any case, as I mentioned before, this is NOT a proposal or pitch or business plan. The implementation off Kadoo and Quin (while not impossible) would require skill and resources. This is not a document about implementation. This is a space to dream.
