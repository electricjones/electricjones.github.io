New Project the [Kaylee Virtual Machine](https://github.com/electricjones/kaylee).
<br /><br />

This is a simple project I'm using to learn more about programming languages and experiment with Domain Specific Languages.
See the github page for the details. Please don't use it for anything important -- I guarentee it has lots of bugs.
