I am announcing the [Games Do Good List](https://github.com/electricjones/games-do-good-list), an open-source list of research documenting the positive impact of games.
<br /><br />

We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, addiction, and on and on.
<br /><br />

This list represents evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side -- a collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.
<br /><br />

It is not a comprehensive list. It is not meant to be a full literature review. It is not authoritative. It does not claim to be unbiased.
<br /><br />

But, this list is a collection of sound research that shows games do good.
<br /><br />

We all knew it.
<br /><br />

## The List
The list is in two categories.
<br /><br />

**Peer Reviewed Research**: These are scientific papers and can be fairly technical. They run the gammit of scientific disciplines.
<br /><br />

**Non Academic**: These are more accessible resource from newspapers and other well-respected individuals and organizations.
