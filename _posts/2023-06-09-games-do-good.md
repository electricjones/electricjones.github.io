I am announcing the [Games Do Good List](https://github.com/electricjones/games-do-good-list), an open-source list of research documenting the positive impact of games.
{: .article_paragraph }

We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, addiction, and on and on.

This list represents evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side -- a collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.
{: .article_paragraph }

It is not a comprehensive list. It is not meant to be a full literature review. It is not authoritative. It does not claim to be unbiased.
{: .article_paragraph }

But, this list is a collection of sound research that shows games do good.
{: .article_paragraph }

We all knew it.
