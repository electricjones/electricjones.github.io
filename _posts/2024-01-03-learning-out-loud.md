<b><i>"If we all carry each other, all get stronger."</i></b>
{: .article_paragraph }

I'm not sure where I first heard that quote -- probably for my grandfather like most of the quotes that wring constantly in my mind.
{: .article_paragraph }

I have been ruminating the idea of "Learning Out Loud" or "Planning Out Loud" for quite awhile. This is not the [Learning Out Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV6hClxfeeM) educational framework. And it may be this concept has another, more appropriate, name I have yet to find. 
{: .article_paragraph }

"Learning Out Loud" is simply going through the educational process transparently and in real time, highs and lows together. 
{: .article_paragraph }

This is different then the educational content we are used to. We often find -- and I dearly love -- well crafted and polished learning experiences: Strategically designed curriculum, well thought out learning paths, and intentionally curated resources. All of these things have their place. Learning out loud is not a concept to supplant or replace these valuable tools. 
{: .article_paragraph }

Instead learning out loud is intentionally messy. How many times have you been learning something -- a new language or programming skill or recipe -- only to fail the first dozen times. Even more, I often set my sights on a big and complex concept with seemingly no end. Those learning experiences are painful. We all know the frustration of floundering in too little or too many resources. We all feel the pain going in the wrong direction. What we don't often enough get to see while becoming "youtube certified" is that <b>everyone</b> has this experience. Everyone gathers their own resources and creates their own map. At best we see the end result of that map, after it has been published and polished and edited. 
{: .article_paragraph }

But the journey has often been more valuable to me then the destination. (Shout out to fellow [Knights Radiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive))
{: .article_paragraph }

I spent nearly a year using all of my free time to learn about and build Quantum Computing tools and languages. I bounced around from concept to concept, from book to book, and from of sub-discipline to some-discipline. In the end, I came to the conclusion that quantum computing (for me) was best a hobby. However, all of that ambling and blundering gave me new skills and new knowledge that I use every day.
{: .article_paragraph }

And I regret that I never shared that journey. That no one else will get to learn from my path, share my resources, and commiserate at the overwhelming choices in self-teaching.
{: .article_paragraph }

So that is what Learning Out Loud means to me. It is openly documenting the learning process, sharing resources along the way, and presenting the side-steps not as mistakes but as crucial steps long the path. 
{: .article_paragraph }

You DO end with a list of resources, guidance on how to get from one place to the other, and notes about the topic. But you also get to someone else working through the same problem. You get to learn in real time from their mistakes. Beyond that, it has a lot of value to the person learning out loud. 
{: .article_paragraph }

So, what follows is a short framework  with justifications and benefits. This is an ongoing work in progress. Just like dog-fooding your own software, I am Learning Out Loud while I learn to Learn Out Loud.
{: .article_paragraph }

## Benefits
{: .article_subtitle }
<b>To the Learner</b> have been discussed, but let's formalize it a bit.
{: .article_paragraph }

1. A large collection of resources that may not have otherwise been collected
2. An example of a path through the learning forest
3. A genuine picture of the struggle of learning the concept
4. Potentially active feedback in the learning process

<b>To the Teacher</b> are also interesting. We know best what we can teach. By including synthesis and presentation in our own learning experience, we solidify what we are learning. We also get to challenge our understanding and have others provide us feedback. And, then, there's the satisfaction of helping others.
{: .article_paragraph }

## The Beginnings of a Framework
{: .article_subtitle }
These are my initial thoughts on learning out loud in general. They are currently disorganized. That's part of the process.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Distinctions of Learning Out Loud
{: .article_subtitle }
I am not proposing a "stream of conciousness" or "complaint" journal. Both of those have their place, but Learning Out Loud is different. The <b>intent</b> is still to produce high quality resources for others to use. The main differences between conventional learning material and Learning Out Loud are:
{: .article_paragraph }

- Learning Out Loud is developed in real time. The "teacher" does not know how the journey will end.
- Learning Out Loud explicitly includes some casual component with which others can engage (a journal or such)
- Learning Out Loud focuses on exploration over prescription. It's more like drawing a map as you make it, with winding branches and paths. The learner can follow those in the same or different order.

BOTH are produced to the highest quality. (With the exception maybe of a journal) Learning Out Loud Lessons and resources are edited, coherent, and polished. 
{: .article_paragraph }

The individual "chapters" are clean while the overall "plot" is still being decided. 
{: .article_paragraph }

### The Components for Learning Out Loud
{: .article_subtitle }
- <b>Resource Library</b>: Learning on your own means collecting lots of articles, videos, books, etc. The resource library is where you share what you have found. But not as a page of ugly links. Share your notes, reviews, and summaries. Draw connections between the resources. Present them with excellence.
- <b>Lessons / Tutorials</b>: Once you have a good understanding of a concept, solidify it into some teaching material. Maybe a video or blog series, or tutorial.
- <b>Journal</b>: This is the less formal component where you more casually share your feelings and revelations in the learning process.
- <b>Live Streams / Chats</b>: An opportunity to engage with other learners.

### Setting Expectations
{: .article_subtitle }
It is important to set expectations about each component. What does the resource library entail? What difficulty are the tutorials? How casual is the journal?
{: .article_paragraph }

### Gathering Resources
{: .article_subtitle }
TODO: Detail my notes for gathering, annotating, and sharing resources. Include some tools.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Keeping Track of Revisions
{: .article_subtitle }
One of the best parts about sharing your work before its fully complete is that others get to see the process of creation. This works best when the learners can see previous revisions of the various components. This could be a changelog or revisions document. I plan to just use git (as on this page)
{: .article_paragraph }

### Publishing Polished Material
{: .article_subtitle }
While Learning Out Loud is certainly less of a polished experience, its still important for the published material to be coherent and clean. 
{: .article_paragraph }

### Publishing Genuine Experiences
{: .article_subtitle }
The material published should be genuine. Do not shy away from sharing where you struggled, what you don't understand, and where you plan to go from here.
{: .article_paragraph }

### Planning Out Loud
{: .article_subtitle }
I am not sure where the distinction is between Planning and Learning out loud. But for my case, Planning (or Building?) Out Loud is about gathering resources, notes, and ideas for projects in the open and inviting others to participate. This is a cornerstone of (some forms of) open source software.
{: .article_paragraph }

## My Learning Out Loud
{: .article_subtitle }
There are a number of projects that I will be "Planning Out Loud". Just look for the "out-loud" tag. I will also be "Learning Out Load" a graduate-level introduction to Game Studies. In all cases, I will tag the posts with an "out-loud" tag as well as the topic, series, and type of post (lesson, resource, journal, etc).
