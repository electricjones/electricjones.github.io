if we all carry each other karma we all are stronger period  paragraph i'm not sure where i first heard that quote karma probably 
from my grandfather like most of the quotes i use car but it it has always wrong in my mind period

 this blog post is about a concept i have been ruminating for quite awhile period it is not related to the learning out loud 
 framework would you can see more about year period

 in short karma learning out loud to me means that wall you are pursuing new location whether professionally 
 karma personally karma or anything in between you do 
 that transparently by sharing your resources and your progress especially your struggles and victories

 not only does this produce resources for others who are interested in you're learning 
 karma but more importantly it shares the genuineness of learning experience period

 we all struggle constantly with new concepts come skills karma and things period we all know the 
 frustration of floundering in too little or too many resources period we all feel the pain of going in the wrong direction period what we don't all get to see is that we are not alone in those struggles period

 we learn more in the process then we do and the actual educational material period

 my hope in learning out loud is not simply to share resources period the internet is full oh 
 learning paths and curriculum and tutorials period while i have been a professional educator karma it's 
 been a long time since i've built for curriculum period

 my purpose is not two craft the most exquisite instructions said period my purpose is to simply 
 shine a light on ambling karma mumbling combo sweet and sour beautiful and painful process of learning period

 so with that in mind drama i'm going to dive in a little bit into a learning out 
 loud him planning out loud to me and how i intend to utilize it on this in my work

<i>"If we all carry each other, all get stronger."</i>

I'm not sure where I first heard that quote -- probably for my grandfather like most of the quotes that wring constantly in my mind.

I have been ruminating the idea of "Learning Out Loud" or "Planning Out Loud" for quite awhile. This is not the [Learning Out Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV6hClxfeeM) educational framework. And it may be this concept has another, more appropriate, name I have yet to find. 

"Learning Out Loud" is simply going through the educational process transparently and in real time, highs and lows together. 

This is different then the educational content we are used to. We often find -- and I dearly love -- well crafted and polished learning experiences: Strategically designed curriculum, well thought out learning paths, and intentionally curated resources. All of these things have their place. Learning out loud is not a concept to supplant or replace these valuable tools. 

Instead learning out loud is intentionally messy. How many times have you been learning something -- a new language or programming skill or recipe -- only to fail the first dozen times. Even more, I often set my sights on a big and complex concept with seemingly no end. Those learning experiences are painful. We all know the frustration of floundering in too little or too many resources. We all feel the pain going in the wrong direction. What we don't often enough get to see while becoming "youtube certified" is that <b>everyone</b> has this experience. Everyone gathers their own resources and creates their own map. At best we see the end result of that map, after it has been published and polished and edited. 

But the journey has often been more valuable to me then the destination. (Shout out to fellow [Knights Radiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive))

I spent nearly a year using all of my free time to learn about and build Quantum Computing tools and languages. I bounced around from concept to concept, from book to book, and from of sub-discipline to some-discipline. In the end, I came to the conclusion that quantum computing (for me) was best a hobby. However, all of that ambling and blundering gave me new skills and new knowledge that I use every day.

And I regret that I never shared that journey. That no one else will get to learn from my path, share my resources, and commiserate at the overwhelming choices in self-teaching.

So that is what Learning Out Loud means to me. It is openly documenting the learning process, sharing resources along the way, and presenting the side-steps not as mistakes but as crucial steps long the path. 

You DO end with a list of resources, guidance on how to get from one place to the other, and notes about the topic. But you also get to someone else working through the same problem. You get to learn in real time from their mistakes. Beyond that, it has a lot of value to the person learning out loud. 

So, what follows is a short framework  with justifications and benefits. This is an ongoing work in progress. Just like dog-fooding your own software, I am Learning Out Loud while I learn to Learn Lut Loud.
